\>BlockDesign( <v>, <B> )
\>BlockDesign( <v>, <B>, <G> )

Let <v> be a positive integer and <B> a non-empty list of non-empty
sorted lists of elements of $\{1,\ldots,<v>\}$.

The first version of this function returns the block design with point-set
$\{1,\ldots,<v>\}$ and block multiset <C>, where <C> is `SortedList(<B>)'
(this is a backward compatible change to {\DESIGN}~1.1, where it was
required that <B> be sorted).

For the second version of this function, we require <G> to be a group
of permutations of $\{1,\ldots,<v>\}$, and the function returns the
block design with point-set $\{1,\ldots,<v>\}$ and block multiset <C>,
where <C> is the sorted list of the concatenation of the <G>-orbits of
the elements of <B>.

\>PGPointFlatBlockDesign( <n>, <q>, <d> )

Let <n> be a non-negative integer, <q> a prime-power, and <d> a
non-negative integer less than or equal to <n>. Then this function
returns the block design whose points are the (projective) points of
the projective space $PG(<n>,<q>)$, and whose blocks are the $<d>$-flats
of $PG(<n>,<q>)$, considering a <d>-flat as a set of projective points.

Note that the *projective space* $PG(<n>,<q>)$ consists of all the
subspaces of the vector space $V(<n>+1,<q>)$, with the *projective
points* being the 1-dimensional subspaces and the *$<d>$-flats* being
the $(<d>+1)$-dimensional subspaces.

\>DualBlockDesign( <D> )

Suppose <D> is a block design for which every point lies on at least
one block.  Then this function returns the dual of <D>, the block design
in which the roles of points and blocks are interchanged, but incidence
(including repeated incidence) stays the same.  Note that, since the
list of blocks of a block design is always sorted, the block list of
the dual of the dual of <D> may not be equal to the block list of <D>.

\>DeletedPointsBlockDesign( <D>, <Y> )

Suppose <D> is a block design and <Y> is a proper subset of the point-set
of <D>.

Then this function returns the block design $DP$ obtained from <D> by
deleting the points in <Y> from the point-set, and from each block.
It is an error if the resulting design contains an empty block.

the corresponding points of <D>; the point-names of $DP$ (listed in

Suppose <D> is a block design, and <Y> is a sublist of the block-list

Then this function returns the block design obtained from <D> by adding
the new point `<D>.v+1' to the point-set, and adding this new point
(once) to each block of <Y> (where repeats count).

The optional parameter <pointname> specifies a point-name for the

\>DerivedBlockDesign( <D>, <x> )

Suppose <D> is a block design, and <x> is a point or block of <D>.
Then this function returns the *derived design*\index{derived design}
$DD$ of <D>, with respect to <x>.

If <x> is a point then $DD$ is the block design whose blocks are those
of <D> containing <x>, but with <x> deleted from these blocks, and the
points of $DD$ are those which occur in some block of $DD$.

If <x> is a block, then the points of $DD$ are the points in <x>, and
the blocks of $DD$ are the blocks of <D> other than <x> containing at
least one point of <x>, but with all points not in <x> deleted from
these blocks.  Note that any repeat of <x>, but not <x> itself, is a
block of $DD$.

It is an error if the resulting block design $DD$ has no blocks or an
empty block.

The points of $DD$ are relabelled $1,2,...$, preserving the order of
the corresponding points of <D>; the point-names of $DD$ (listed in
`$DD$.pointNames') are those of these corresponding points of <D>.

\>TDesignFromTBD( <D>, <t>, <k> )

For $t$ a non-negative integer, $K$ a set of positive integers, and
$v,\lambda$ positive integers with $t\le v$, a $t$-*wise balanced design*,
or a $t$-$(v,K,\lambda)$ *design*, is a binary block design with exactly
$v$ points, such that each block has size in $K$ and each $t$-subset of
the points is contained in exactly $\lambda$ blocks.

Now let <t> and <k> be positive integers, <D> be a <t>-$(v,K,\lambda)$
design (for some set $K$), and $<t>\le <k>\le k_1$, where exactly $s$
distinct block-sizes $k_1\< \cdots \< k_s$ occur in <D>. Then this
function returns the <t>-design $D^{*}=D^{*}(t,k)$ described and studied
in \cite{McSo}.

The point set of $D^{*}$ is that of <D>, and the block multiset of $D^{*}$
consists of, for each $i=1,\ldots,s$ and each block $B$ of <D> of size
$k_i$ (including repeats), exactly $n/{k_i-t \choose k-t}$ copies of
every $k$-subset of $B$, where $n:=\lcm({k_i-t \choose k-t}:1\le i\le s)$.

It is shown in \cite{McSo} that $D^{*}$ is a $t$-$(v,k,n\lambda)$ design,
that $\Aut(D)\subseteq\Aut(D^{*})$, and that if $\lambda=1$ and $t\<k$,
then $\Aut(D)=\Aut(D^{*})$.

Note: This is a change, mostly of notation, from version~1.1 of
{\DESIGN}. For backward compatiblity, this function also performs as
described in the version 1.1 documentation, but we discourage such use.
