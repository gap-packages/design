                        The DESIGN Package for GAP

This README describes the {\DESIGN}~1.5 package for {\GAP}~4.5.
The {\DESIGN} package is for constructing, classifying, partitioning
and studying block designs.

The {\DESIGN} package is included as part of the {\GAP}~4.5 distribution.
However, {\DESIGN} requires the {\GRAPE} package for {\GAP} to be
fully installed, and makes use of certain {\GRAPE} functions, some of
which make use of B.D. McKay's {\nauty}.  All {\DESIGN} functions are
written entirely in the {\GAP} language, so no further installation of
the {\DESIGN} package is required after installing {\GAP} and {\GRAPE}.

The {\DESIGN} package is Copyright {\copyright} Leonard H. Soicher
2003--2011.  {\DESIGN} is part of a wider project, which was funded
by EPSRC, to provide a web-based resource for design theory; see
\URL{http://designtheory.org}.

it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by

Main changes from DESIGN 1.4 to DESIGN 1.5
------------------------------------------

(1) Added internal function: 
   DESIGN_IntervalForLeastRealZero

(2) Added user functions: 
   PointBlockIncidenceMatrix
   ConcurrenceMatrix
   InformationMatrix
   BlockDesignEfficiency

(3) Updated documentation, including documentation for
    the new user functions.

Main changes from DESIGN 1.3 to DESIGN 1.4
------------------------------------------

(1) Added function: AGPointFlatBlockDesign.

(2) Improved and documented the main features of function
SemiLatinSquareDuals, which can be used to classify (n x n)/k semi-Latin
squares and SOMA(k,n)s with given properties.

(3) Improved efficiency of function PGPointFlatBlockDesign.

(4) Made function TDesignLambdas faster, in particular in the case of
a point-transitive design, when that design's record includes a known
point-transitive subgroup of the design's automorphism group.

(5) Improved the (undocumented) function IsPossiblySBIBD so that
TDesignBlockMultiplicityBound now makes full use of the Bruck-Ryser-Chowla
Theorem when t=2 and k<v=b.

(6) Improved the speed of functions TDesignBlockMultiplicityBound and
ResolvableTDesignBlockMultiplicityBound by employing binary search to
find the bounds.

Main changes from DESIGN 1.2 to DESIGN 1.3
------------------------------------------

(1) Added function: WittDesign.

(2) Fixed a bug which caused a break loop to be entered in certain cases
in function BlockDesigns when the least element of blockSizes was equal
to tSubsetStructure.t.

(3) Fixed a rarely occurring bug which caused no designs to be returned
in function BlockDesigns in certain cases when the designs had just one
block each.

(4) Small improvements made to the documentation and the code.

Main changes from DESIGN 1.1 to DESIGN 1.2
------------------------------------------

(1) Added functions:
   BlockIntersectionPolynomial
   BlockIntersectionPolynomialCheck
   TDesignLambdas
   TDesignLambdaMin
   TDesignIntersectionTriangle
   SteinerSystemIntersectionTriangle
   TDesignBlockMultiplicityBound
   ResolvableTDesignBlockMultiplicityBound
   BlockDesignPoints
   NrBlockDesignPoints
   BlockDesignBlocks
   NrBlockDesignBlocks
   PairwiseBalancedLambda
   AffineResolvableMu
   DeletedPointsBlockDesign
   DeletedBlocksBlockDesign
   AddedPointBlockDesign
   AddedBlocksBlockDesign
   DerivedBlockDesign
   ResidualBlockDesign

(2) The function BlockDesign can now (optionally) construct a block
design from base blocks and a group of automorphisms, and the list 
of blocks given to BlockDesign need no longer be sorted.

(3) Improved documentation of the function TDesignFromTBD, and changed
the parameters (in a backward compatible way) to match the description
of the "*-construction" in the McSorley-Soicher paper.

(4) The (undocumented) resolveSimple option removed from functions
BlockDesigns and PartitionsIntoBlockDesigns, and the option b added
to these functions (to specify the number of blocks in a required block
design or partition part). 

(5) Improvements made to the use of store (and time?) by the function 
BlockDesigns.

Main changes from DESIGN 1.0 to DESIGN 1.1
------------------------------------------

(1) Made compatible with GAP 4.4 and its package loading mechanism.
DESIGN 1.1 works only with GAP 4.4/GRAPE 4.2/GAPDoc.

(2) Upgraded XML I/O to DTRS protocol 2.0.

(3) BlockDesignsToXMLFile has additional parameters to allow more user
control over expansion, output, and design id's. The default now is for
minimal expansion and writing out, which is a *change* from DESIGN 1.0.

(4) Added functions:
   BlockDesignIsomorphismClassRepresentatives,
   DualBlockDesign,
   ComplementBlocksBlockDesign.

(5) Function names made read-only.

(6) Some utility functionality moved to GRAPE 4.2.

(7) Added files README and gpl.txt.
